# CSS - Cascading Style Sheets

Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media.

CSS allows for control over multiple web pages at once, enabling the separation of presentation from content. This separation can improve content accessibility, provide more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enable multiple HTML pages to share formatting, and reduce complexity and repetition in the structural content.

Some key features of CSS include:

- **Selectors and Properties:** CSS uses selectors to bind styles to HTML elements, and properties to define the values of styles.
- **Layout Techniques:** CSS offers different layout techniques like Flexbox, Grid Layout, and Box Model.
- **Responsiveness:** CSS allows for the creation of responsive web designs, ensuring web pages work well on a variety of devices and window or screen sizes.
- **Styling Features:** You can style backgrounds, borders, text, and more, to create visually appealing web pages.

CSS is maintained by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C).
