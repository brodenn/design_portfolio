# SQLite - Database Management System

SQLite is a software library that provides a relational database management system in a C library. It is known for its portability, reliability, and lightweight nature, as it's a self-contained, serverless, zero-configuration, and transactional SQL database engine.

Key characteristics of SQLite:

- **Self-contained:** SQLite is a self-contained system that requires minimal support from external libraries or the operating system.
- **Serverless Architecture:** Unlike most other SQL databases, SQLite does not have a separate server process. SQLite reads and writes directly to ordinary disk files.
- **Zero Configuration:** No setup or administration is needed.
- **Cross-Platform:** The SQLite file format is stable, cross-platform, and backward compatible, and the developers pledge to keep it that way.
- **Uses in Web Browsers and Mobile Apps:** SQLite is widely used in mobile apps and web browsers, making it one of the most widely deployed databases.

SQLite's simplicity and ease of use make it a popular choice for applications where a full-scale SQL server would be overkill, such as small to medium-sized applications, embedded systems, and for local/client storage in application software.
