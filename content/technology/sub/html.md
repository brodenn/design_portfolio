# HTML - HyperText Markup Language

HTML, or HyperText Markup Language, is the cornerstone of web content and structure. It is used to create and visually structure web pages on the internet. HTML elements form the building blocks of all websites and are responsible for the placement and layout of text and other multimedia on a page.

Key aspects of HTML include:

- **Element Structure:** HTML uses a tree-like structure with nested elements, allowing for clear hierarchy and organization of content.
- **Semantic Tags:** Tags like `<header>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`, and `<section>` describe the purpose of the element, aiding in accessibility and SEO.
- **Forms and User Input:** HTML forms are essential for interactive websites, allowing user input and interaction.
- **Multimedia Integration:** HTML supports embedding images, videos, and audio, enabling rich multimedia experiences.
- **Hyperlinks:** The basis of web navigation, hyperlinks (created with the `<a>` tag) allow users to jump from page to page.

HTML works in conjunction with CSS and JavaScript to create fully-functional, aesthetically pleasing web applications. It's constantly evolving, with HTML5 being the latest standard.
